        "text": " This is a Neanderthal skull. Neanderthals are extinct species of humans and we believe they went extinct about 35 to 40,000 years ago. But my question was always, how do we know these things? How do we figure these things out? But how does that work? How do you use radio activity to figure out how old something is? Now if you take any amount of carbon 14 you want, take any amount you want. Let's just take some number nice nice number 100 grams, let's say. Now as time passes by, the atoms will start decaying and so the amount of carbon 14 that you have will start reducing as an it. Now it turns out that after about 5,730 years 50 grams of carbon 14 would have decayed to nitrogen 14 and only 50 grams is left with you. My intuition says you should now go to zero all of the carbon 14 should decay. I mean make sense right like in the first phase, in the first 5,730 years 50 grams of decay. Now we wait for the same amount of time. Another 50 gram would decay. So obviously you should go to zero. But turns out that's not what happens. Instead we find that now half of half of this amount gets decayed. So from 50 grams 25 grams get decayed and we are left with another 25 grams. And the same thing continues if you wait for another 5,730 years half of this value gets decayed and so on and so forth. That's how radio activity proceeds. So this means regardless of whatever amount of carbon 14 you have with you. It doesn't matter what amount you have. But if you wait for 5,730 years it will reduce to half its value half of whatever you have right now. And therefore that is called that number is called half life. It's a number that tells you how much time you have to wait for 50 percent half of the amount of stuff that you have to decay. It could be half of the mass that you have to decay. It could be half of the number of atoms that you currently have to decay, number of moles, whatever it's half of the amount of stuff. How much time you have to wait for half this amount of stuff to decay. Let's take another example. If you take uranium 238, turns out that it is a radio isotope and turns out that whatever daughter isotope you get after the decay also undergoes another radioactive decay. And there's a chain like that. But eventually it ends in lead. Now that's besides the point. What's important is the half life of uranium 238 happens to be about 4 and a half billion years. Now what does that mean? What it means is that if you take some amount of uranium 238 with you, again it doesn't matter what amount you take with you right now. Let's take some random 68 grams. You have 68 grams of uranium 238 with you. Now if you wait for 4 and a half billion years that amount will reduce to half. What happens if you wait another 4 and a half billion years? Well again that amount will not vanish now. Again it will reduce to half. And then it will keep on happening. Half life. So each radio isotope will have its own half life. But the big question is why does radioactive you proceed like this? To gain some insights into this, let's play a game. Let's put 100 million people in a room and decide to toss a coin every minute. Now if you get a tail, you're done. The game is over, you leave the room. But if you get a head, you stay in the room, wait for another minute and toss a coin again. And you keep on doing this. So my question to you is, what's going to happen after a minute? We start the game, wait for a minute, everybody tosses a coin. How many people will be left in the room after one minute? Well you would say that tossing a coin is a random event. So there's a 50% chance of getting a heads or tails. If I focus on any one individual, I have no clue whether that person is going to get a heads or not. Heads or tails. But since I have 100 million people, statistics come into play. So 50% of this group is going to get heads and about 50% will get tails. Which means half of them will stay in the room and other half would have left. So we would have 50 million in the room, isn't it? Now we continue. We wait for one more minute. What do you think is going to happen? Do you think now all 50 million would leave the room? No, you would say, hey, the same thing is going to happen again. Because again, 50% of, you know, there's a random chance, 50% of them will get heads. 50% of them will get tails. Which again, only 50% of this will stay. That is 25 million will stay and the game will continue like that."

        "text": " in the very next minute. I have no clue. I cannot comment on what happens individually. But because we have 100 million of them statistics becomes more significant. I can tell that 50% of this must keep decaying 50% of them must leave. Something very similar is happening over here. If you take a single atom, there's no way to predict what's going to happen. It might decay the very next second or it may not decay for another billion years. There's absolutely no way to talk about that. But if you take billions and trillions and trillions of atoms together, if you take a lot of them together, then statistics become significant. And so in four and a half billion years, if half of them decay, well, then in another four and a half billion years, again, only half of them must decay. And that's why in thing must continue. Does that make sense? Think about this for a while. The cure here is that video activity is a random process. And that's why the chances of a radioactive atom decaying at any given moment is 50%, 50% chance of decay, 50% chance it will not decay. This is the reason why the statistics works out. And by the way, there's absolutely no way you can influence those chances. There's nothing you can do that will say, uh, force it to decay or will stop it from decaying. All you can do is just sit back and watch it. This also means that the half life of a radioactive sample is fixed. For example, carbon 14 always has a half life of 5,730 years period. It doesn't matter how much carbon 14 you take under what conditions you take it. None of that matters. Similarly, half life of your aim to 38 is always going to be 4 and a half billion years done. And that's awesome because not just by looking at half life, you can comment about which, uh, you know, which isotopes are more radioactive. I mean, which of these two do you think is more radioactive? Well, carbon 14 only takes about 5,700 years to decay to half the value. But uranium takes about 4 and a half billion years. So you can immediately see because it has a shorter half life. Carbon 14 must be more radioactive. Short of the half life, the quicker it decays, more radioactive something is. There are isotopes which have half life in mere seconds. Anyways, now there's one big difference between the game that we played and how radioactive it unfolds in reality. What's that difference? Well, let me just move this thing to the side. So if you go back to our game that we played and we try to draw a graph on the y-axis will plot the number of people who are remaining and on the x-axis will draw the number of half lives. Initially, we had a hundred million people to begin with. So 100% of them very meaning and they stayed in the room for about a minute. Then they tossed a coin and then immediately that number reduced to half half of it 50%. And then again, that stayed in the room for a minute and then again, it immediately reduced to half and that kept on going, right? Well, the difference is in actual radio activity, it doesn't happen like this. It's not like the 68 grams will stay 68 grams for a 4 and a half billion years and then instantly reduced to 34 grams like over here. Instead, that radio activity is a continuous process that will be continuously the amount of the amount of isotope that you have continuously decay. This number will continuously reduce. And so the actual graph that you get will be more of a curve that looks like this. But the point is, after if you wait for one half life, which could be 5,000, 7, 30 years for carbon 14 or 4 and a half billion years for uranium to 38. But if you wait for one half life, look, the number reduces to 50% and then if you wait for the second half life, another half life, the number reduces to 50% of that, which is 25% and so on and so forth. This now brings us to our original question. How do you figure out age of things? For example, how do you figure out how old Earth is? Actually, what's so special about these crystals? They absolutely hate lead. Well, not worry about why that is the case, but that turns out to be true. But let's say you find a zircon crystal and inside you'll find some traces of uranium and some lead as well. And just to keep taking simple numbers, I'm just taking 10 milligrams and 10 milligrams over here. Okay. But then you question like, where did this lead come from? You realize, hey, a lot of this uranium is radioactive. And so this lead must have come from the decay of uranium."
