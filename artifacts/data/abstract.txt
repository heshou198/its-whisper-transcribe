The introduction to MIT's Course 600 in Computer Science and Programming, taught by Professors Eric Grimson and John Guttag, has the goal of helping individuals learn about computation. The course aims to prepare students for majoring in Course 6, build coding confidence, understand computation's role in technical problems, and acquire various computational skills. The curriculum includes lectures, recitations, and problem sets in Python, with a focus on understanding the limitations and capabilities of computation. Two quizzes are scheduled, and students should check the website for any conflicts. Problem sets are designed to aid in learning, and students are encouraged to seek help if needed. Recitation sign-up is required, an optional textbook is suggested, and attendance is strongly encouraged. Extensive material is covered, and TAs may lack patience, so responsible behavior is expected. Class notes are not handed out, so valuable note-taking is recommended. Handouts with code examples are provided for lectures, but attending the lecture is crucial for clear understanding. Instructors and staff are available for assistance, and recitations are required for additional material.
