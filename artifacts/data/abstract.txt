MIT's Course 600: Computer Science and Programming is designed to introduce the basics of computation, aiming to prepare potential majors for advanced courses and empower non-majors with the ability to write and read small code pieces. The target audience is students with minimal to zero programming knowledge, while students with extensive programming knowledge are advised to seek alternative courses. The course encourages understanding of computational possibilities and limitations and emphasizes critical skills such as code reading and writing. The course is primarily conducted online, with additional materials and lectures posted on the website. Twice weekly lectures, a Friday recitation, and regular problem sets form the core structure of the course, while grades are derived 55% from problem sets and 45% from quizzes or final exam.
