        "content": "- Radioactive decay statistics become significant when taking into account large numbers of atoms\n- A single atom's decay cannot be predicted, but with many atoms, statistics become meaningful\n- Radioactive decay is a random process with a 50% chance of decay at any given moment\n- The half-life of a radioactive sample is fixed and can be used to determine relative radioactivity\n- Shorter half-lives indicate more radioactive isotopes\n- Radioactivity is a continuous process, unlike the sudden decreases in the game example\n- The graph of radioactive decay shows a continuous reduction in the number of isotopes over time\n- The age of objects can be determined using radioactive decay, such as uranium-lead dating of zircon crystals\n- Lead is a byproduct of uranium decay, allowing for age determination based on the ratio of lead to uranium in a sample"
