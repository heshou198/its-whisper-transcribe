    ## Abstract
    This abstract summarizes the use of radioactivity to date objects and determine the age of Earth. It explains the concept of half-life and how uranium and lead decay can be used to estimate the age of zircon crystals. The abstract also mentions that radioactivity is a random process with varying levels of radioactivity.

    ## "Understanding Radioactivity and Half-Life"
Neanderthals went extinct, radioactivity used to date objects, carbon 14 decay, uranium 238 half-life, radioisotopes decay like coin toss.
### Notes on Extinction and Radioactivity

- Neanderthals went extinct about 35 to 40,000 years ago.
- Radioactivity is used to determine the age of objects.

### Carbon 14 Decay

- Carbon 14 decays over time, reducing in amount.
- After 5,730 years, **50 grams** of carbon 14 decays to **nitrogen 14**.
- Half of the remaining amount of carbon 14 decays after each 5,730-year period.
- The time it takes for half of a substance to decay is called its **half-life**.

### Uranium 238 Decay

- Uranium 238 has a half-life of about **4 and a half billion years**.
- Each radioisotope has its own unique half-life.

### Radioactivity Comparison

- Radioactivity proceeds in a similar way to a game of tossing a coin.
- After each minute, **half** of the people in the room will leave, based on random chance.

### Table: Carbon 14 Decay

| Time Period | Amount of Carbon 14 Remaining |
|-------------|------------------------------|
| 0 years     | 50 grams                     |
| 5,730 years | 25 grams                     |
| 11,460 years| 12.5 grams                   |
| ...         | ...                          |

Note: The amount of carbon 14 reduces by half after each 5,730-year period.

### Table: Uranium 238 Decay

| Time Period           | Half-Life |
|-----------------------|-----------|
| 0 years               | 4.5 billion years |
| 4.5 billion years     | 2.25 billion years |
| 9 billion years       | 1.125 billion years |
| ...                   | ...       |

Note: Uranium 238 has a half-life of about 4 and a half billion years.
## "Understanding Radioactivity and Using it to Determine Age"
Radioactivity is a random yet continuous process with a fixed half-life and varying levels of radioactivity, and it can be used to determine the age of Earth through uranium and lead decay in zircon crystals.
### Radioactivity

- **Radioactivity** is a random process.
- The chances of a radioactive atom decaying at any given moment is **50%**.

### Half-life

- The **half-life** of a radioactive sample is fixed.
- **Carbon-14** has a half-life of *5,730 years*, while **uranium-238** has a half-life of *4.5 billion years*.
- Shorter half-life indicates higher radioactivity.

### Radioactive Decay

- In reality, radioactive decay is a continuous process.
- The graph of radioactive decay is a curve.
- After one half-life, the number reduces to *50%*, after the second half-life it reduces to *25%*, and so on.

### Age Determination

- **Zircon crystals** can be used to determine the age of Earth using uranium and lead decay.
