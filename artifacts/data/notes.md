# Lecture Notes

## Abstract
The introduction to MIT's Course 600 in Computer Science and Programming, taught by Professors Eric Grimson and John Guttag, has the goal of helping individuals learn about computation. The course aims to prepare students for majoring in Course 6, build coding confidence, understand computation's role in technical problems, and acquire various computational skills. The curriculum includes lectures, recitations, and problem sets in Python, with a focus on understanding the limitations and capabilities of computation. Two quizzes are scheduled, and students should check the website for any conflicts. Problem sets are designed to aid in learning, and students are encouraged to seek help if needed. Recitation sign-up is required, an optional textbook is suggested, and attendance is strongly encouraged. Extensive material is covered, and TAs may lack patience, so responsible behavior is expected. Class notes are not handed out, so valuable note-taking is recommended. Handouts with code examples are provided for lectures, but attending the lecture is crucial for clear understanding. Instructors and staff are available for assistance, and recitations are required for additional material.

## "Mapping Scientific Problems into a Computational Framework: An Introductory Course"
Learn to map scientific problems into a computational framework through lectures, recitations, and problem sets in Python, with an emphasis on understanding the limitations and capabilities of computation.
### Course Overview

In this course, students will develop the ability to map scientific problems into a computational framework and learn to read, write, and understand what can and cannot be done in computation. They will also learn how to take a description of a problem from another domain and map it into the domain of computation. The course will require 2 hours of lecture per week on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 11, 1 hour of recitation per week on Fridays, and 9 hours of outside class work, primarily focused on problem sets involving programming in Python. The difficulty of the problem sets will gradually increase throughout the course, and there will be heavy use of libraries or pre-existing code.

### Course Administration

| Class Schedule                 |                                  |
|------------------------------- |--------------------------------- |
| Lecture Times                  | 2 hours per week on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 11 |
| Recitation Times               | 1 hour per week on Fridays        |
| Outside Class Work             | 9 hours per week, primarily working on problem sets |
| Programming Language           | Python                           |
| Difficulty of Problem Sets     | Increase gradually               |
| Use of Libraries and Code      | Heavy                             |

### Learning Objectives

- Develop the ability to map scientific problems into a computational framework.
- Learn to read, write, and understand what can and cannot be done in computation.
- Take a description of a problem from another domain and map it into the domain of computation.
## "Course Overview and Expectations"
Two quizzes scheduled (Oct 2nd, Nov 4th), check website for conflicts; problem sets help learn; seek help if needed.
### Course Notes

- **Quizzes**:
  - Two quizzes during the term, dates already scheduled (October 2nd and November 4th)
  - Check the course website for quiz dates and any conflicts
  - If there is a conflict, see the instructor to arrange something ahead of time
  - If there is an MIT-documented special need for taking quizzes, see the instructor well in advance (at least two weeks before the quiz)
  - Quizzes are open book and open note, testing your ability to think

- **Grades**:
  - Grades: 55% from problem sets, 45% from quizzes (10%, 15%, and 20%)
  - Final exam during final period
  
- **Problem Sets**:
  - First problem set (problem set 0) has already been posted, easy and to familiarize with Python
  - First problem set will be posted shortly, somewhat boring but will become more interesting
  - Problem sets are not intended to be lethal, they are to help you learn
  - Seek help if you don't understand a problem set, either psychiatric help or a TA
  - The goal is for problem sets to be straightforward if you start down the right path
  - This should not be a grueling test, it's meant to help you learn
  - Ask for help from the instructors or TAs if needed
  
- **Recitation**:
  - The course is primarily paperless, check the website for all necessary information
  - Fill out a form on the website to sign up for a recitation on Fridays (9, 10, 11, 12, 1, and 2), one may be dropped depending on course size
## "Course Guidelines: Sign Up, Optional Textbook, Attendance, and the Importance of Note-Taking"

- Recommended to use notes to take personal annotations

### Class Notes
- No class notes provided to encourage individual learning process
- Instructors and staff are there to help students learn
- Encouraged to ask for assistance when struggling or uncertain

### Class Recording
- Class being videotaped for OpenCourseWare
- Students who don't want their image recorded should sit in the back three rows
