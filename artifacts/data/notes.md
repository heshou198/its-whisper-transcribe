# Lecture Notes

## Abstract
MIT's Course 600: Computer Science and Programming is designed to introduce the basics of computation, aiming to prepare potential majors for advanced courses and empower non-majors with the ability to write and read small code pieces. The target audience is students with minimal to zero programming knowledge, while students with extensive programming knowledge are advised to seek alternative courses. The course encourages understanding of computational possibilities and limitations and emphasizes critical skills such as code reading and writing. The course is primarily conducted online, with additional materials and lectures posted on the website. Twice weekly lectures, a Friday recitation, and regular problem sets form the core structure of the course, while grades are derived 55% from problem sets and 45% from quizzes or final exam.

## "Introduction to MIT's Course 600: Computer Science and Programming"
Course 600: Introduction to Computer Science & Programming taught by Professors Grimson & Guttag. Content under a Creative Commons license, it teaches computational thinking, coding, and computational problem-solving. Ideal for beginners to programming.
- The content is provided under a Creative Commons license.
- The course, 600, is also known as Introduction to Computer Science and Programming.
- Course lecturers are Professor Eric Grimson and Professor John Guttag, who have been lecturing for 25 and 30 years respectively.
- Study of computation is seen as very important.
- Course goals: Ability to understand and implement the concepts and tools of computational thinking; to think like a computer scientist.
- Strategic course goals: Preparing undergraduate students interested in Course 6, especially beginners in programming; enabling students not majoring in Course 6 to write and read small pieces of code; understanding the role computation can play in solving technical problems; building the confidence and competence for computational problem-solving.
- The course is mainly beneficial for students who are new to programming. 
- Students who have extensive programming experience may not benefit as much from the course.
- Key skills for students to acquire: Using computational thinking to write small-scale programs; understanding programs written by others; understanding the features, limits and costs of computation.
- Understanding the limitations of computation is seen as crucial.
## "Mapping Scientific Problems into a Computational Framework: An Introductory Course"
The course taught latest skill of mapping scientific problems into computational framework. Course details include two lectures, one recitation each week, and nine hours of class work primarily involving Python programming. Course uses external libraries/code.
- The last tactical skill acquired from course: ability to map scientific problems into a computational framework
- Students will learn to take a problem description and map it into something computational
- The course aims to provide the foundation for students to translate problems from various domains into computational language
- Discussion on what computation is and how to build tools related to it is forthcoming in the course
- Course administration details:
   - Two hours of lecture a week
   - Class timing: Tuesdays and Thursdays at 11
   - One hour of recitation a week on Fridays
   - Nine hours a week of class work outside the classroom
   - Work involves primarily solving problem sets through programming in Python
   - Problem sets vary in difficulty level, increasing as the term progresses
   - Course will make heavy use of libraries or code written by other people.
## "Course Overview and Expectations"
Understand course materials and codes. Two quizzes, dates TBA, conflicts to be communicated. Special needs noted 2 weeks prior to quiz. Quizzes are open book/notes. Problem sets 55% of grade, quizzes 45% including final. Course mainly paperless via website. Recitations on Fridays.
- Understand the course materials thoroughly, including familiarizing with course codes rather than just writing from scratch.
- Quizzes: Two quizzes scheduled; exact dates will be shared on the course website.
- Conflicting Schedule: If any student faces conflict with the quiz schedule, communicate immediately.
- Special Needs: Any pre-existing, documented special needs must be noted to the course administrators at least two weeks before a quiz.
- Quizzes are open book/notes since the course isn’t about memorization but thinking process.
- Grading Distribution: Problem sets contribute 55% of the total grade, whereas quizzes contribute the remaining 45%. The final exam is also included in quizzes' 45%.
- Challenge Level of Problem Sets: Problem sets are not designed to be difficult but to aid in learning. Assistance is available if needed.
- Platform: The course will primarily be conducted in a paperless format via the course website. Recitations to be signed up through the course website.
- Recitations: Held on Fridays; potential times are 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, and 2. Changes may occur based on course size.
## "Course Guidelines: Sign Up, Optional Textbook, Attendance, and the Importance of Note-Taking"
Course requires sign-ups for recitation, optional Python textbook, attendance not mandatory but participation encouraged, no set course text, reading is expected but not fully covered in materials, low TA priority for text/lecture related questions, responsible behavior needed, notes not provided and students encouraged to self-note-take for retention.
- Students are required to sign up for recitation times that suit them, but course leaders reserve the right to adjust as needed for balance.
- Textbooks are not required for the course; one suggested piece for Python is available for those who feel the need for one.
- There are no specific texts that the course heavily relies on.
- Attendance is not mandatory, although participation and engagement are encouraged.
- Material covered in the course may not all be found in the assigned readings; understanding of lecture and reading content is expected.
- Questions that pertain to content covered in readings or lectures might not be given priority by TAs.
- Responsible behavior from students is expected, and the course leaders will reciprocate.
- Class notes will not be distributed; students are encouraged to take their own notes.
- Studies have shown that students retain knowledge better when they write down notes, even if they never review them. Note-taking is beneficial as it exercises both halves of the brain.
## "Importance of Class Participation, Note Taking, and Attendance in Lectures and Recitations"
Lecture handouts contain code examples; staff aid learning but won't answer easily Google-able questions; classes recorded for OpenCourseWare; recitation attendance expected; established rules must be understood.
- Most lectures will have a handout, mainly composed of code examples.
- Handout codes may not make sense outside the context of the lecture.
- Lecturers encourage using handouts as a basis for personal notes.
- Teaching staff's main role is to aid students' learning process.
- Students are advised to seek help from staff when struggling conceptually. 
- Staff is not responsible for answering questions easily answered by lecture attendance, course readings, or a simple Google search.
- The semester's classes are being recorded for OpenCourseWare.
- Those who do not wish to be on camera should sit in the last three rows.
- Recitations form an integral part of the course, with attendance expected.
- Material unique to recitations, not available in lectures or readings, will be covered. 
- Ground rules need to be clearly understood by all.
