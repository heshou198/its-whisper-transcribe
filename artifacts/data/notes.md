    ## Abstract
    This abstract explores the concept of radioactive decay and the relationship with half-life. It discusses how radioactive decay statistics demonstrate both randomness and predictability, particularly when examining large numbers of radioactive particles. The notes highlight the significance of understanding these principles in the study of nuclear physics and related fields.

    ## "Understanding Radioactivity and Half-Life"
Radioactive decay and half-life concept explained.
### Radioactivity and Half-Life

- **Neanderthals**: *extinct species* of humans; believed to have gone extinct *35-40,000 years ago*

- **Radioactive decay**: used to determine the age of objects

- **Carbon 14 example**: 50% decay every *5,730 years*

- **Half-life**: *time for half the amount* of radioactive substance to decay

- **Uranium 238 example**: *half-life of* 4.5 billion years

- **Radioisotopes**: have their own half-life

- **Radioactive decay analogy**: *coin tossing game* with 100 million people
    - Half of the group leaves after each round of coin tosses (*50% probability*)

- **Half-life concept**: explained with *statistical probability* and *random events*

### Radioactive Decay Example

| Element       | Half-Life          |
|---------------|--------------------|
| Carbon 14     | 5,730 years        |
| Uranium 238   | 4.5 billion years  |
## "The Significance of Radioactive Decay Statistics"
Radioactive decay statistics show randomness and predictability with large numbers.
### Radioactive Decay Statistics

- Indent knowledge, **bold keywords**, and *italicize examples*. Format appropriate data into tables. 

Radioactive decay statistics become significant when taking into account large numbers of atoms. A single atom's decay cannot be predicted, but with many atoms, statistics become **meaningful**. Radioactive decay is a **random process** with a **50% chance** of decay at any given moment. The **half-life** of a radioactive sample is fixed and can be used to determine relative **radioactivity**. Shorter half-lives indicate more radioactive isotopes. Radioactivity is a **continuous process**, unlike the sudden decreases in the game example. The graph of radioactive decay shows a continuous reduction in the number of isotopes over time. The age of objects can be determined using radioactive decay, such as **uranium-lead dating** of zircon crystals. Lead is a byproduct of uranium decay, allowing for age determination based on the ratio of lead to uranium in a sample.

**Note:** The table below provides an example of radioactive decay data for an isotope.

| Time (years) | Number of Isotopes |
|--------------|---------------------|
| 0            | 1000                |
| 10           | 500                 |
| 20           | 250                 |
| 30           | 125                 |
| 40           | 62.5                |
| 50           | 31.25               |
