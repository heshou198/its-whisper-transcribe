# Lecture Notes

## Abstract
MIT's Course 600: Computer Science and Programming is designed to introduce the basics of computation, aiming to prepare potential majors for advanced courses and empower non-majors with the ability to write and read small code pieces. The target audience is students with minimal to zero programming knowledge, while students with extensive programming knowledge are advised to seek alternative courses. The course encourages understanding of computational possibilities and limitations and emphasizes critical skills such as code reading and writing. The course is primarily conducted online, with additional materials and lectures posted on the website. Twice weekly lectures, a Friday recitation, and regular problem sets form the core structure of the course, while grades are derived 55% from problem sets and 45% from quizzes or final exam.

This content is provided under a **Creative Commons license**.

The course, known as **600**, or **Introduction to Computer Science and Programming**, is led by **Professor Eric Grimson** and **Professor John Guttag**, who have a combined total of 55 years of lecturing experience.

| Lecturer              | Years of Experience |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Professor Eric Grimson| 25 years            |
| Professor John Guttag | 30 years            |

The **study of computation** is a pivotal cornerstone of this course.

## Course Goals

The course is designed to impart:

1. The ability to **understand** and **implement** the concepts and tools of **computational thinking**
2. To think like a **computer scientist**

## Strategic Course Goals

Specifically, this course aims at:

1. Preparing undergraduate students interested in Course 6, especially beginners in programming
2. Enabling students not majoring in Course 6 to write and read small pieces of code
3. Understanding the role computation can play in solving technical problems
4. Building the confidence and competence for computational problem-solving

## Who Will Benefit?

The course is largely beneficial for **students who are new to programming**. *For instance, those who haven't been exposed to coding language before would find this course extremely valuable.*

However, students who have extensive programming experience may not benefit as much from this course.

## Key Skills to Acquire

Students are expected to acquire these key skills:

1. Using computational thinking to write small-scale programs. 
    -*Example*: writing a basic program that adds up all the numbers in a list.
2. Understanding programs written by others.
    -*Example*: reading and understanding the logic in a chunk of code written by a classmate.
3. Understanding the features, limits and costs of computation.

Understanding the **limitations of computation** is seen as particularly crucial.

## "Mapping Scientific Problems into a Computational Framework: An Introductory Course"
The course taught latest skill of mapping scientific problems into computational framework. Course details include two lectures, one recitation each week, and nine hours of class work primarily involving Python programming. Course uses external libraries/code.
>**The last tactical skill acquired from course:** *Ability to map scientific problems into a computational framework*
>
>Students will learn to take a problem description and map it into something computational. The **course** aims to provide the foundation for students to translate problems from various domains into **computational language**.
>
>A discussion on what **computation** is and how to build tools related to it is forthcoming in the course.
>
>**Course administration details:**
>
>|  |  |
>| --- | --- |
>| Lecture hours: | Two hours a week |
>| Class timing: | Tuesdays and Thursdays at 11 |
>| Recitation: | One hour a week on Fridays |
>| Out of class work: | Nine hours a week |
>| Nature of Work:| Primarily solving problem sets through programming in **Python** |
>| Problem Sets: | Vary in difficulty level, increasing as the term progresses |
>|Particulars | The course will make heavy use of libraries or code written by other people. |

## "Course Overview and Expectations"
Understand course materials and codes. Two quizzes, dates TBA, conflicts to be communicated. Special needs noted 2 weeks prior to quiz. Quizzes are open book/notes. Problem sets 55% of grade, quizzes 45% including final. Course mainly paperless via website. Recitations on Fridays.
**Understand** the course materials thoroughly, including familiarizing with course codes rather than just writing from scratch. 

**Quizzes:** Two quizzes are scheduled; exact dates will be shared on the **course website**.

> *If any student faces conflict with the quiz schedule, communicate immediately*—**Conflicting Schedule**

**Special Needs:** Any pre-existing, documented special needs must be noted to the course administrators at least two weeks before a quiz.

Quizzes are open book/notes since the course isn’t about memorization but thinking process.

**Grading Distribution:**

| Instruction  | Percentage  |
|---|---|
| Problem sets  | 55%  |
| Quizzes (including final exam) | 45%  | 

**Challenge Level of Problem Sets:** Problem sets are not designed to be difficult but to aid in learning. Assistance is available if needed. 

**Platform:** The course will primarily be conducted in a paperless format via the **course website**. *Recitations to be signed up through the course website*.

**Recitations:** Held on Fridays; potential times are 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, and 2. Changes may occur based on course size.
## "Course Guidelines: Sign Up, Optional Textbook, Attendance, and the Importance of Note-Taking"
Course requires sign-ups for recitation, optional Python textbook, attendance not mandatory but participation encouraged, no set course text, reading is expected but not fully covered in materials, low TA priority for text/lecture related questions, responsible behavior needed, notes not provided and students encouraged to self-note-take for retention.
> **Students** are required to sign up for **recitation times** that suit them, but **course leaders** reserve the right to adjust as needed for balance.
>
> **Textbooks** are not required for the course; one suggested piece for *Python* is available for those who feel the need for one.
>
> There are no specific **texts** that the course heavily relies on.
>
> **Attendance** is not mandatory, although **participation** and **engagement** are encouraged.
>
> Material covered in the course may not all be found in the assigned readings; understanding of **lecture and reading content** is expected.
>
> Questions that pertain to content covered in readings or lectures might not be given priority by **TAs**.
>
> **Responsible behavior** from students is expected, and the course leaders will reciprocate.
>
> **Class notes** will not be distributed; students are encouraged to take their own notes.
>
> Studies have shown that students retain knowledge better when they write down notes, even if they never review them. *Note-taking* is beneficial as it exercises both halves of the brain.

|:--------------:|--------------------------------|
| Students       | Need to register for appropriate recitation times |
| Textbooks      | Not required, supplemental material available for Python |
| Attendance   | Not mandatory, but participation and engagement appreciated |
| Lecture and reading content | Understanding and comprehension are necessary |
| TAs | May not prioritize all questions |

| Note-taking | Benefits learning and retention, exercises brain |
## "Importance of Class Participation, Note Taking, and Attendance in Lectures and Recitations"
Lecture handouts contain code examples; staff aid learning but won't answer easily Google-able questions; classes recorded for OpenCourseWare; recitation attendance expected; established rules must be understood.
---

* **Most lectures** will have a **handout**, mainly composed of code examples.
    * _Example: Handout codes may not make sense outside the context of the lecture._
* **Lecturers** encourage using handouts as a basis for **personal notes**.
* The **teaching staff's main role** is to aid students' **learning process**.
    * _Example: Students are advised to seek help from staff when struggling conceptually._
* **Staff** is **not responsible** for answering questions easily answered by:
    * Lecture attendance
    * Course readings
    * A simple Google search
* The **semester's classes** are being recorded for **OpenCourseWare**.
    * Those who do not wish to be on camera should sit in the **last three rows**.
* **Recitations form an integral part** of the course, with **attendance expected**.
* **Material unique to recitations**, not available in lectures or readings, will be covered.
* **Ground rules** need to be clearly understood by all.
